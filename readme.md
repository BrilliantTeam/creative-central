A Minecraft plugin that unifies the server's resource-pack, allowing other plugins
to programmatically add resources to the server's resource-pack.

`creative-central` allows server administrators to use multiple plugins that
use resource-packs without conflicts. `creative-central` currently supports
Paper and Minestom *(Network support with Velocity soon)*
